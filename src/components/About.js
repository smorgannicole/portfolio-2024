              I was first introduced to coding in my CS Fundamentals class
              during my second year of collegeâ€” I finished with a C. Five years
              later I attended both Codeup and LEARN academy, full stack web
              development bootcamps. Despite Codeup's closure midway through the
              course, I was able to further solidify my skills in frontend
              languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React during my time
              at LEARN Academy. If I went back now, I'd like to think I could
              make at least a B in CS Fundamentals.

              Outside work, I enjoy friendly games of chess (add me on chess.com
              @smorgannicole), any spectator sport, live music, discovering the
              magic of the world with my partner, and spending quality time with
              my animals.
